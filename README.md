This is a simple hangman game application coded using JavaScript. It allows users to play the classic word-guessing game.

## Features

Guessing: The player can guess letters to try and uncover the hidden word.
Correct and Wrong Choices: The game keeps track of the player's correct and wrong letter guesses.

## Getting Started

To play the hangman game, you need a web browser that supports JavaScript. Follow these steps:

Download or clone the hangman repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
You should now see the hangman game interface in your browser.

## Usage
The game will start automatically when you open the page.
The hidden word will be represented by dashes (_) indicating the number of letters.
Guess a letter by clicking on the corresponding letter button on the interface.
If the guessed letter is correct and present in the word, it will be revealed in the appropriate position(s).
